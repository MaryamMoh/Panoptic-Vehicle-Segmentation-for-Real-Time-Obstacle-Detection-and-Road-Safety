# Panoptic-Vehicle-Segmentation-for-Real-Time-Obstacle-Detection-and-Road-Safety
This repository implements Panoptic Segmentation for vehicles, combining instance and semantic segmentation to enhance real-time obstacle detection and road safety. Using deep learning, it identifies vehicles and road elements, enabling precise spatial awareness for ADAS and autonomous driving.
